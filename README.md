This project aims to provide an efficient and scalable database system for a supermarket. The system is designed to manage the supermarket's inventory, sales, and customer data, and to facilitate the process of stock management and replenishment.

The project utilizes several technologies, including SQL and C# , to create a functional and user-friendly interface for supermarket staff. The database schema is well-designed, with tables for products, categories, suppliers, customers, and sales, among others.

The system provides various features, such as product search, stock management, and order processing, which help to streamline the supermarket's operations and improve its overall efficiency. It also includes an intuitive user interface that makes it easy for staff to navigate and use the system.

This project includes a well-documented codebase, which can be easily understood and modified by developers. The project also includes a MySQL database, which is used to store all supermarket-related data.
